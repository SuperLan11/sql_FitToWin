To use the database, you need an application that runs MySQL, such as MySQL Workbench.
After downloading the sql file, open your MySQL application and connect to your server (assuming you have a server connection established).

If you have a database already set up, you will see it in your schema.
Double-click a database you would like to use for the project.
Then open the sql file with your MySQL application from your files.
Use Control-A and copy all of the code to the tab with the database you want to use.
Run the code to create all the tables at once. Then you can delete all the code that was copied and use queries.
